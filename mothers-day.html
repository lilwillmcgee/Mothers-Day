        <h1>"Mother" By: Lola Ridge</h1>
        <h1>"Your love was like moonlight
            turning harsh things to beauty,
            so that little wry souls
            reflecting each other obliquely
            as in cracked mirrors . . .
            beheld in your luminous spirit
            their own reflection
            transfigured as in a shining stream,
            and loved you for what they are not.
            You are less an image in my mind
            than a luster
            I see you in gleams
            pale as star-light on a gray wall . . .
            evanescent as the reflection of a white swan
            shimmering in broken water."</h1>
